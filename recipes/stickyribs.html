<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<h4>4 servings</h4>
<ul>
    <li>4 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
    <li>4 teaspoons white sugar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
    <li>2 racks baby back pork ribs</li>
</ul>
<h4>Glaze:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>1/3 cup ketchup</li>
    <li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons soy sayce</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to <strong>250 degrees F</strong> <em>(120 degrees C)</em></li>
    <li>Mix salt, sugar, black pepper, paprika, and garlic powder for dry rub together in a small bowl. Set aside.</li>
    <li>Line a large sheet pan with heavy-duty aluminum foil. Place rack of ribs on the prepared pan, bone side down. Poke all over with a sharp knife. Make shallow slits across at an angle, and then repeat the opposite way; this allows the dry rub to penetrate.</li>
    <li>Coat on both sides with rub; flip back over, ensuring the bone side is down. Wrap tightly with foil.</li>
    <li>Transfer to the center of the preheated oven and bake for 2 hours. Remove from the oven and let cool to room temperature. Refrigerate until cold and firm, at least 2 hours, up to overnight.</li>
    <li>Preheat a charcoal grill until coals are very ashy and hot.</li>
    <li>Remove from the refrigerator, unwrap, and brush off excess fat. Slice between the bones to separate each rib.</li>
    <li>Combine ketchup, brown sugar, soy sauce, vinegar, oil, and cayenne with a spoon in a bowl for glaze.</li>
    <li>Place ribs on the preheated grill and cook for 2 minutes; flip and brush over glaze. Flip and repeat process until ribs are as caramelized as you prefer, about 10 minutes more.</li>
    <li>Remove to a plate and brush over one more application of glaze</li>
    <li><strong>Serve and enjoy!</strong></li>
